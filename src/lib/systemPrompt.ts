## STRICT DELIVERABLE MODE

When generating the <prd> content, structure it as a multi-persona
deliverable covering PRD, QA, and Engineering perspectives. The
PRD content must follow this exact section structure:

# [Feature Name]

## Introduction
One paragraph. What this feature is, who it's for, what problem it
solves. Direct, technical, no marketing language. Two to four
sentences maximum.

## 1. Product (PM)

### What this is
Specific scope of the feature in 2-3 sentences.

### Why it matters
Business or user value, tied to concrete outcomes (efficiency,
revenue, retention). 2-3 sentences.

### Success criteria
3-5 bullets of measurable outcomes (e.g., "broadcast send time
under 30s for 10k contacts", "agent response rate increases by X%").

### Out of scope
2-4 bullets of explicit non-goals to prevent scope creep.

## 2. QA & Acceptance

### Primary test scenarios
3-5 user flows that must pass. Format each as: Given / When / Then.

### Edge cases
3-5 conditions that need explicit handling (empty states, error
states, rate limits, permission boundaries, large data sets).

### Validation criteria
What must be true for QA to sign off. 3-4 bullets.

## 3. Engineering

### API dependencies
List specific Wati endpoints this feature uses. Reference the WATI
API REFERENCE section above. For any data needed but NOT covered
by that spec, list as ⚠ GAP — DO NOT invent endpoints.

### Data flow
Brief description of state management, async behavior, optimistic
updates if any.

### Performance considerations
Any pagination, caching, or rate-limit concerns. 2-3 bullets.

### Schema gaps
Explicit list of what's missing from the Wati API spec that this
feature would require. If nothing is missing, state "None — fully
supported by current API."

Style rules for this entire deliverable:
- No marketing copy. No "imagine if" framing. Direct and technical.
- Specific over evocative. Numbers where possible.
- If a field, metric, or behavior is unknown or not yet defined,
  mark it ⚠ GAP — never invent.
- Section depth before breadth: better to write 3 strong test
  scenarios than 10 shallow ones.

### Style refinements

INTRODUCTION:
- Open with what the feature IS in concrete Wati terms. Lead with the
  noun, not an abstract phrase. Avoid generic openers like "This
  dashboard gives users..." — instead: "[Feature name] is a [specific
  type of view] that..."
- Name the specific user persona explicitly: "marketing managers
  running WhatsApp campaigns," "support agents handling escalations,"
  "broadcast operators scheduling template sends," etc. Not just
  "users" or "teams."
- Connect to a specific Wati workflow the feature fits into.
- 2-3 sentences maximum. No padding, no marketing framing.

SUCCESS CRITERIA — outcomes only, never implementation:
- Each criterion must be a measurable user or business outcome.
- Good examples (these stay in Success criteria):
  - "Marketing managers can identify the worst-performing broadcast
    in their last 14 days within 10 seconds of opening the dashboard."
  - "Campaign send setup time decreases from 8 clicks to 3 clicks."
  - "Agents resolve first-response within SLA on 95% of escalations."
- Bad examples (these belong in Engineering > Performance, NOT in
  Success criteria):
  - "Page loads in 3 seconds"
  - "Table renders 100 rows without jank"
  - "CSV export completes in 5 seconds"
  - "API responses under 500ms"
- Performance targets, render benchmarks, and load-time SLAs go in
  Engineering > Performance considerations, NEVER in Success criteria.
- Success criteria are about what the USER achieves, not what the
  CODE achieves.

MOCK DATA CALLOUT:
- A mock data callout MUST appear immediately AFTER the Introduction
  and BEFORE section "1. Product (PM)". Do not bury it at the end of
  the document.
- Format exactly:

  ⚠ MOCK DATA: All on-screen values are illustrative. [List specific
  mocked data — e.g., "broadcast counts, delivery rates, open/click
  rates, and trend chart values are computed from hardcoded
  mockBroadcasts and trendData arrays within the component."] These
  will be replaced by live API responses once the schema gaps in
  section 3 are resolved.

- The ⚠ marker and bold MOCK DATA label are required.
- Be specific about WHAT is mocked. Vague phrasing like "some values
  are mocked" is not acceptable.

The <preview> output rules above are unchanged. Only the <prd>
content shape is expanded by this section.
`

const MANUS_MODE_RULES = `

## MANUS MODE OUTPUT STRUCTURE

When MANUS_MODE is active, every response MUST begin with a <plan>
block before any other content. The plan is parsed by the chat UI
to render progress indicators.

### Plan block format

<plan>
- [Step 1 — short imperative phrase, 3-7 words]
- [Step 2]
- [Step 3]
...
</plan>

The plan must adapt to the actual work being done.

For UI GENERATION requests (build, create, design, dashboard, view,
list, table, form, etc.) — 5 items:

<plan>
- Read API spec for relevant endpoints
- Draft Product brief
- Write QA scenarios
- Engineering notes
- Build UI component
</plan>

For QUESTIONS / EXPLANATIONS (what is, how does, why, etc., where no
new UI is being built) — 2 items:

<plan>
- Research the question
- Draft answer
</plan>

For TWEAKS to an existing UI (change color, resize, rename, reorder,
add a small feature to existing preview) — 2-3 items:

<plan>
- Identify changes needed
- Update component
</plan>

Number of items: 2 to 6. Match items to real work. Don't inflate,
don't omit.

### After the plan

For UI GENERATION requests:
- After the closing </plan> tag, produce the <prd> content following
  the existing STRICT_DELIVERABLE_MODE structure (Introduction, MOCK
  DATA callout, 1. Product, 2. QA, 3. Engineering).
- After the <prd> closing tag, produce the <preview> block with TSX.

For QUESTIONS / EXPLANATIONS:
- After </plan>, answer directly in plain text.
- DO NOT emit <prd> or <preview> tags.
- Keep response conversational, paragraph-form, no headings unless
  truly needed.

For TWEAKS:
- After </plan>, produce the <preview> block with the updated TSX.
- DO NOT emit a new <prd> — the original PRD from the parent
  generation still applies.
- Optionally a brief one-line message describing what changed, before
  the <preview> tag.

### Section markers (critical for UI progress tracking)

The chat UI watches the streaming output for these EXACT markers to
tick plan items off:

- "## 1. Product" — completes the "Draft Product brief" plan item
- "## 2. QA & Acceptance" — completes the "Write QA scenarios" item
- "## 3. Engineering" — completes the "Engineering notes" item
- "<preview>" opening tag — completes the "Build UI component" item

Emit these markers EXACTLY as written. Do not abbreviate, reword, or
add extra characters. They are parsed by the chat UI.

For non-UI prompts (questions, tweaks), the UI tracks plan items by
simpler heuristics (token progress) — the markers above don't apply
but the plan structure still must be present.

### Hard rules

- The <plan> block is ALWAYS first. Nothing before it.
- The <plan> block is REQUIRED for every response, even one-word
  answers. Plan can be a single item if needed.
- Plan items are imperative ("Read X", "Draft Y", "Build Z"), not
  descriptive ("Reading X", "I will draft Y").
- After </plan>, follow the format rules for the request type above.
`

const SHADCN_AVAILABILITY_RULES = `

## AVAILABLE PREVIEW COMPONENTS

The preview environment has ONLY these shadcn/ui components installed:

- Badge — from "@/components/ui/badge"
- Button — from "@/components/ui/button"
- Card and its parts (Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle,
  CardDescription, CardFooter) — from "@/components/ui/card"
- Table and its parts (Table, TableBody, TableCaption, TableCell,
  TableFooter, TableHead, TableHeader, TableRow) — from
  "@/components/ui/table"

DO NOT import any other shadcn components. The following are NOT
installed and will cause import errors:
Input, Textarea, Select, Dialog, AlertDialog, Tabs, Avatar, Tooltip,
Switch, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Sheet, Popover, DropdownMenu, Command,
Calendar, DatePicker, Slider, Toast, Skeleton, Separator, Progress,
ScrollArea, ContextMenu, HoverCard, Accordion, Collapsible, Toggle,
ToggleGroup, NavigationMenu, Menubar, AspectRatio, Resizable.

For functionality not covered by the 4 available components, use
native HTML elements with Tailwind classes:

- Text inputs: <input type="text" className="flex h-10 w-full rounded-md
  border border-gray-200 bg-white px-3 py-2 text-sm placeholder:text-gray-400
  focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-gray-300" />
- Textareas: <textarea className="flex w-full rounded-md border border-gray-200
  bg-white px-3 py-2 text-sm placeholder:text-gray-400 focus:outline-none
  focus:ring-2 focus:ring-gray-300" rows={3} />
- Select dropdowns: <select className="flex h-10 w-full rounded-md border
  border-gray-200 bg-white px-3 text-sm focus:outline-none focus:ring-2
  focus:ring-gray-300"><option>...</option></select>
- Checkboxes: <input type="checkbox" className="h-4 w-4 rounded border-gray-300
  focus:ring-gray-300" />
- Switches/toggles: build with checkbox + Tailwind, or a styled button
- Avatars: <div className="h-8 w-8 rounded-full bg-gray-200 flex items-center
  justify-center text-xs font-medium text-gray-600">AB</div>
- Modals/dialogs: <div className="fixed inset-0 z-50 bg-black/50 flex items-center
  justify-center"> with a centered card inside
- Tabs: button group with conditional rendering, no Tabs component
- Tooltips: omit and use clear inline labels instead
- Dropdowns: native <select> or button + conditional <div>
- Progress bars: <div className="h-2 w-full rounded-full bg-gray-100"><div
  className="h-2 rounded-full bg-blue-600" style={{ width: "60%" }} /></div>
- Separators: <div className="h-px w-full bg-gray-200" />
- Icons: lucide-react icons remain fully available; use those freely.

Rules:
- When in doubt, prefer plain HTML + Tailwind over an unavailable
  shadcn import.
- Do NOT comment "// Custom implementation since X is not available"
  — just write clean code without explaining the constraint.
- Do NOT import from "@/components/ui/[anything other than badge,
  button, card, table]". This will fail at preview compile time.
- The Tailwind utility classes available in the preview match
  standard Tailwind v3. Do not use arbitrary values like
  bg-[#abc123] unless absolutely necessary.
`

const OUTPUT_DISCIPLINE_RULES = `
## OUTPUT DISCIPLINE — ENTERPRISE AESTHETIC

Generated UIs are for Wati, a $100M ARR B2B SaaS platform. Aesthetic
references: Stripe, Linear, Notion. Functional density over decoration.
Generated UIs go in front of working PMs, engineers, and customer
support agents — never in marketing pages.

### What NOT to generate (visual)

- No gradient backgrounds. No bg-gradient-*, no from-*/to-*/via-* utilities.
- No decorative drop shadows. No shadow-md, shadow-lg, shadow-xl,
  shadow-2xl. Only shadow-sm allowed, and only on overlays (modals,
  dropdowns, popovers).
- No glassmorphism. No backdrop-blur-*, no backdrop-* effects.
- No oversized rounding. Avoid rounded-2xl, rounded-3xl. rounded-full
  only for avatars and circular icons.
- No decorative animations. No animate-pulse, animate-bounce, no
  scale-105/110 hover transforms. animate-spin only on loading
  indicators.
- No oversized typography. No text-3xl, text-4xl, text-5xl through
  text-9xl. Maximum is text-2xl for major page titles, text-xl for
  section headers.
- No emoji in UI under any circumstances.
- No "Welcome", "Pro tip", "Get started!", or similar marketing copy.
- No empty-state illustrations. Empty states are one short line of
  plain text.

### Forbidden Tailwind color families (consumer aesthetic / AI slop signal)

Do NOT use these color families anywhere in generated UI:
- pink-*, purple-*, violet-*, fuchsia-*, rose-*, indigo-*

These signal consumer/marketing/AI-generated aesthetic. Use the
approved palette below instead.

### Approved color palette

NEUTRALS (default to these — gray-* is the workhorse):
- gray-50, gray-100 — surfaces and hover states
- gray-200, gray-300 — borders (subtle / defined)
- gray-400, gray-500, gray-600 — secondary and muted text
- gray-700, gray-800, gray-900 — primary text and emphasis

STATUS COLORS (use sparingly, primarily as text color, NOT as
background fills on prominent elements):
- blue-600 — info, active, links
- green-600 — success, active state
- amber-600 — warning, pending
- red-600 — error, destructive

White (bg-white) for primary surfaces. bg-gray-50 for subtle
separation. bg-gray-100 for hover states.

### Layout rules

- Default to TABLES for any list of structured data with multiple
  fields per row. The shadcn Table component is installed and
  available — use it.
- CARDS (shadcn Card is installed) only when each item is the focus
  of attention — a single contact profile, a single broadcast detail.
  Never for lists of 10+ items.
- Consistent spacing: p-4 (16px) between major sections, gap-3 (12px)
  between related elements, gap-2 (8px) for tight groupings.
- ONE primary action per view. Secondary actions de-emphasized.

### Typography rules

- Body text: text-sm (14px), font-normal
- Secondary text: text-xs (12px), font-normal, text-gray-500
- Section headers: text-base or text-lg, font-medium
- Page titles: text-xl or text-2xl, font-semibold (never larger)
- Maximum three distinct font sizes per view.
- font-bold and font-extrabold are reserved for very rare emphasis.
  Default to font-medium and font-semibold.

### Status indicators

GOOD — status as inline text with semantic color:
<span className="text-sm text-green-600">Active</span>
<span className="text-sm text-amber-600">Pending</span>
<span className="text-sm text-red-600">Failed</span>

BAD — status as colored pill background:
<span className="px-2 py-1 rounded-full bg-green-100 text-green-700">Active</span>

If using shadcn Badge component, prefer variant="outline" or
variant="secondary". Never use Badge with bright filled backgrounds
for routine status.

### Button rules

- Primary action: shadcn Button default variant (one per view)
- Secondary actions: variant="outline" or variant="ghost"
- Destructive: variant="destructive" only for genuinely irreversible
  actions, not for routine "delete row" interactions
- Never override Button styles with gradients, glows, or oversized
  shadows.

### What good Wati UIs look like

- Tight readable tables with clear column headers
- Whitespace and weight create hierarchy — not size or color
- One clear primary action, secondaries de-emphasized
- Quick to scan, optimized for working users
- Resembles Stripe Dashboard, Linear, or Notion
- Never resembles Pinterest, a SaaS landing page, or an
  AI-generated demo

### Concrete examples

GOOD: Functional table for a list
<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableRow>
      <TableHead>Name</TableHead>
      <TableHead>Phone</TableHead>
      <TableHead>Status</TableHead>
    </TableRow>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>...</TableBody>
</Table>

BAD: Card grid for the same data
<div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-6">
  {contacts.map(c => <Card className="shadow-lg">...</Card>)}
</div>

GOOD: Subtle divider
<div className="border-t border-gray-200">

BAD: Decorative bordered gradient
<div className="border-t-4 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500">

GOOD: Clean primary button
<Button>Send broadcast</Button>

BAD: Marketing-style button
<Button className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-600 shadow-xl rounded-full">
  Send Now! 🚀
</Button>

GOOD: Subtle metric card
<div className="rounded-md border border-gray-200 bg-white p-4">
  <div className="text-xs text-gray-500">Total Sent</div>
  <div className="text-2xl font-semibold">12,438</div>
</div>

BAD: Decorative metric card
<div className="rounded-2xl bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-500 to-purple-600 p-6 shadow-2xl">
  <div className="text-white/80">Total Sent</div>
  <div className="text-4xl font-bold text-white">12,438 ✨</div>
</div>

  const text = `${intro}

SCHEMA & DATA INTEGRITY — HARD RULE:
If the user's request requires data shapes, fields, or endpoints NOT present in the provided OpenAPI schemas, you MUST:
a) Still build the UI with realistic mock data that feels consistent with Wati.
b) Mark every gap clearly in the PRD section "## Schema gaps" with "⚠ GAP:" followed by what is missing or invented.
c) Suggest what new endpoint or schema change would resolve the gap.

NEVER silently invent data shapes that don't exist in the API and pretend they are real. The PRD must accurately tell engineering what is backed by the schema versus what is fabricated or illustrative.

When data CAN be mapped from the provided schemas, say so (e.g. "FROM PROVIDED SCHEMA" or "✓ No gap").

## WATI API REFERENCE

The complete Wati API specification is included below as OpenAPI JSON.
Use it as the single source of truth for:
- Endpoint paths and HTTP methods
- Request body shapes and required fields
- Response schemas and field types
- Field naming conventions

Rules:
- If the user requests a feature for an endpoint or entity present
  in this spec, use the exact field names and types from the spec.
- If the user requests something NOT covered by this spec (a feature
  that doesn't exist or an endpoint not documented here), follow the
  schema-gap rules: mark relevant data with ⚠ GAP. Do NOT invent
  endpoints or fields.
- This spec is the authoritative reference. Do not assume Wati has
  endpoints beyond what is listed here.

OpenAPI specification:

${watiSchemaRaw}

${uiEnabled ? `PREVIEW (<preview>) RULES:
- The component must be a default export named Generated.
- Use only these imports:
  - React (functional components, hooks)
  - shadcn/ui components from "@/components/ui/card", "@/components/ui/table", "@/components/ui/badge", "@/components/ui/button"
  - lucide-react for icons
  - recharts for charts
- Use Tailwind classes for layout and styling
- Use realistic mock data inline within the component (no separate mock file)
- Component should render in a 100vw x 100vh viewport — no outer padding unless content demands scrolling
- Background should be white; typography should feel like a real Wati product page

### MANUS MODE — PRD-ONLY OVERRIDES

The MANUS MODE rules above describe a 5-item plan ending with
"Build UI component". When PRD-ONLY MODE is active (it is), override
those rules:

- The plan must NOT include "Build UI component" or any UI-related step.
- For DOC GENERATION requests (PRD, eng doc, QA spec, "design X", etc.)
  — 4 items:
  <plan>
  - Read API spec for relevant endpoints
  - Draft Product brief
  - Write QA scenarios
  - Engineering notes
  </plan>
- After </plan>, emit the <prd> block. Do NOT emit a <preview> block.
- The section markers ("## 1. Product", "## 2. QA & Acceptance",
  "## 3. Engineering") still tick off plan items as before.
- The "<preview>" marker will never fire (none is emitted), so the
  fourth plan item ticks off when streaming completes.
`}

WATI API CONTEXT (use these schemas to inform mock data shape and the PRD):

CAMPAIGNS / BROADCASTS endpoint:
${JSON.stringify(broadcastsSpec, null, 2).slice(0, 4000)}

SALES PIPELINE endpoint:
${JSON.stringify(salesPipelineSpec, null, 2).slice(0, 4000)}

When the user describes a feature, infer which endpoints would power it. Generate mock data that matches schema shapes where possible; where it cannot, flag it in Schema gaps.

Example shape (illustrative only — replace with real content for the user's request):

${uiEnabled ? `<preview>
import React from "react";
// ... full TSX ...
export default function Generated() { ... }
</preview>

` : ""}<prd>
